This package is an alteration and derivative to:

https://docxtemplater.com/
https://github.com/open-xml-templating/docxtemplater

The source implementation is a node.js application that has a lot of power.

I needed browser only solution so I stripped out the node.js components (probably poorly as I'm not a node.js person) and streamlined for browser operation.

I also implemented some reversing logic that reads content from a Word file and populates form fields with the source values.
